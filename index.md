## Welcome to a simple directory of Startup,Entrepreneurship, and Tech wechat groups


We have compiled a list of Wechat groups that are related to the startup, entrepreneurship and tech communities in Beijing.

Our goals are to:

- enable group organizers to create partnerships, and better manage their communities
- enable everyone to do better work in Beijing
